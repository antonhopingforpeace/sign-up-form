# sign-up-form
I have not coded in a very long time, it will take me a while to complete this i believe.
I am going to remember a bit of CSS and HTML while doing this, luckily for me. I will start grinding on Tuesday the 25th of June.
During this project, i will learn how to put a background photo, how to put a logo and how to style a form. Hopefully i am able to do so.
